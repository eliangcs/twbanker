How It Works & Disclaimer
-------------------------

TW Banker is a simple web crawler that logs in your bank's web site and parses
out your bank balances. It asks for your login crendentials every time you
execute the command. It does not store any of your login crendentials locally
nor remotely, so using this tool should be pretty safe.

I use this tool personally and I will do my best to make it safe to use.
However, I do not guarantee that the tool is 100% safe. I (the author) and any
future contributors of TW Banker will not account for any lost caused by using
this tool. Please use at your own risk.
